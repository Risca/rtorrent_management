This program will get a list of seeding torrents and for every torrent check
the ratio and age. If the ratio is above 1.5 or the torrent is older than 3
weeks, the base path is checked to determine if the torrent is a movie or a
series. If that's the case, the torrent is removed and then the files are
erased.
